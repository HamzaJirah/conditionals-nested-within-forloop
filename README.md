# Nested Conditional in a Forloop
**This forloop takes in a conditional statement**

* Defined a start point; the variable 2, end point; when evenNum is less than or equal to 30 and the increment; that is eveNum++. All within the forloop syntax
* Nested within the forloop is the if statement which checks to see if a number is even, and if it is, the number is printed out. The document.write() built in function is used to do this.
* Noted: only even numbers between 2 and 30 are printed out.
